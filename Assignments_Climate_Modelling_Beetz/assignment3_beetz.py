"""
Single column radiative convective model of a dry troposphere.

The atmoshpere is well mixed and convection happens instantaneously.

Assignment 3 

1) Yes, since the variable is returned
2) The value of the albedo will be the same as the old value since the
value change inside the function has no effect on the outside value. Call by value effect?
This effect is the same if the variable is not given as an argument.
6) Changing the atmospheric temperature by the factor of 20 increases the iterations.
If the atmospheric temperature is higher the delta increases more and therefore takes longer to drop 
under the threshold. In other words, it takes longer for the system to stabilze.
7) In my opinion the maximum number of iterations which is defined by the threshold
depends on the computing capacity and the needs for precise output. With my laptop it would
be no problem to set the threshold much stricter.
