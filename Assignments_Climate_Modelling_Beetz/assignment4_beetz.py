This is an implementation of daisy world: a theoretical 
model of the Gaia hypothesis. This theory was initially developed by 
Lovelock (1983) to demonstrate the plausibility of living things 
interacting with, and regulating, their environment.

    Wood, A. J., G. J. Ackland, J. G. Dyke, H. T. P. Williams, and T. M. 
        Lenton, 2015: Daisywolrd: a Review. Rev. Geophys., 46, RG1001, 
        https://doi.org/10.1029/2006RG000217.

1.
only white: 
- alphaw: can be between 1 and 0 (since it's set to 0.1 if < 0.1)
- alphab minimum = 0
- can exist with luminosity > ~0.8 

only black:
- alphab: same as white
- alphaw minimum = 0
- can exist with luminosity > ~0.63

both:
- default settings
- whites: starting with luminosity > ~0.7
- blacks: starting with luminosity > ~0.63 -> same as when only blacks

Whites can exits with lower levels of luminosity when blacks also exits.
The reason is that blacks increase the temperature and therefore enhance
the growing of whites.

2. 
For a long survival of both kinds and a good temperature moderation,
the difference of the two albedos matters. The bigger it is the longer
both can live and the climate is being kept on a moderate level (alphaw=0.9, alphab=0.1)

3.
No it makes the two daisy types compete for creating the optimun temperature.
This leads to extreme ups and lows in the death and birthrate.
Whichever daisy has the lower optimun temperature wins and can repress the other species.
For some reason the Land coverage sometimes excees 100% (can't find explanation)

4. 
The effect of very high death rates (e.g. 0.9) has the expected impact that the daisies only exist
for a very short period of time not enhancing each others growth and covering only little surface.
However a low deathrate doesn't have much effect. The planet regulates itself, having the similar 
maximums and minimums for both daisy types. Only the surface coverage and the lifetime of the daisy types
increases.

"""TFL
1) Correct, good. 
2) Correct. Generally speaking, increasing the albedo makes them survive at higher luminosities. There are also more nuanced effects of the albedos on the survivability if they are modified separately but not as dramatic.
3) Yes competition is important here. And for your case It sounds like you got a zigzag pattern.
There are a range of effects on the populations if the parameters are modified one at a time.
Increasing optw (eg 300) should increase the survivability of the white daisies at higher luminosity, while black daisies will go extinct slightly earlier (because white daisies become more competitive). Decreasing It will thus reduce the survivability of white daisies, and therefore there will be a smaller range of habitable luminosities.
Increasing optb increases the survivability of the back daisies. Black daisies start growing at higher luminosities, and the white daisies will start growing at slightly lower luminosities also. Decreasing the optb generally decreases the survivability of black daisies.
Increasing the optimum temperature of both the same amount will generally cause a much wider range of survivable luminosities. Decreasing both at the same time has the opposite effect.
4) Good.
5) see email.
